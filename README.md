# Role Tribe

As Part of the Living Together initiative, a template for a tribe/village
construct is created. Feel free to join the effort by supplying Pull Requests
and issues to this repo.

# Rules for Living in the Tribe

 1. People are humans. Therefore, we assume good intent behind their actions.
 1. People are humans. Therefore, we encourage mistakes.
 1. People are humans. Therefore, we treat them with love and respect.
 1. Core Leadership comes from the founding family.
 1. There is no inheritance. Generational shifts happen by new families
    founding new tribes and open transition paths for members.
 1. Membership to this tribe is not exclusive.
 1. The tribe knows about all memberships of their members in other tribes.
 1. The core membership unit is a family. A family is a group of 3-9 people
    who agree to share political, financial and emotional responsibility for
    each other.

# Rules of Engagement with the Tribe

 1. The tribe is open for collaboration with other tribes.
 1. The tribe shares its knowledge and ideas openly with other tribes.
 1. Families can request membership in the tribe.
 1. Individuals can request membership in the tribe by joining a member-family.
    Again: The tribe deals with families as smallest unit. Families deal with
    individual people.
